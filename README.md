# Synthetic-ai-production
This is the production side of my SyntheticAi project. In this repository I only have the js and html; while the rails api is hosted through heroku. To see a live demo of this site go to dmarcr1997.github.io/Synthetic-ai-production/. If any problems arise feel free to reach out.
